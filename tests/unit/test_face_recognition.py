NETRAKSH — Unit tests for edge/detection/face_recognition.py's real
WatchlistFaceRecognizer (SIH PS 26187: "support facial recognition", not
detection alone).

Uses real cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer against real (synthetic but
genuinely distinct) grayscale images — not mocked. Requires
opencv-contrib-python-headless (see requirements.txt); the plain
opencv-python-headless package never ships cv2.face.
