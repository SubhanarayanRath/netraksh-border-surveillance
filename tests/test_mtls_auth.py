Phase 4 WP-2: mTLS Edge Identity Tests

NOTE: These tests require a fully configured mTLS environment and TLS termination proxy
or direct Uvicorn ASGI configuration which is not present in the restricted
development environment.

EXECUTION STATUS: NOT EXECUTED — ENVIRONMENT BLOCKED

Because terminal/subprocess execution is unavailable in the current environment,
these tests have been written to strictly validate the security posture but
have not been executed against a live test-runner.
