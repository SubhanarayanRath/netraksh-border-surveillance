"""
NETRAKSH Backend — Application settings loaded from environment / .env file.

PRODUCTION STARTUP VALIDATION:
  When ENV=production, the application refuses to start if any of the
  following conditions are detected:
    - SECRET_KEY is the default CHANGE_ME placeholder
    - ADMIN_PASSWORD is one of the known weak defaults ("admin")
    - INITIAL_OPERATOR_PASSWORD is one of the known weak defaults ("operator")
    - INITIAL_AUDITOR_PASSWORD is one of the known weak defaults ("auditor")
    - DATABASE_URL still points to the previously-leaked credential pattern

  These checks are bypassed in ENV=development to preserve local dev
  convenience. They are NEVER bypassed in ENV=production or ENV=staging.

  To switch to production mode locally:
    ENV=production (in .env) — then all required vars must be set securely.

SECRETS THAT MUST NEVER APPEAR IN LOGS / SOURCE / GIT:
  SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, INITIAL_OPERATOR_PASSWORD,
  INITIAL_AUDITOR_PASSWORD
