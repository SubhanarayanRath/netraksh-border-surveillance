NETRAKSH — Escalation engine.
Implements §1.3: trigger cross-command alert when BOTH conditions hold:
  1. severity >= HIGH
  2. the track's trajectory approaches/crosses a boundary zone
     (zone.adjacent_command_id is not None)

Only this code path submits to blockchain.

Cross-camera corroboration boost (backend/services/cross_camera.py): a
MEDIUM-severity event that has strong, real corroboration from another
camera (see that module's docstring for exact scope — temporal + real-
distance plausibility, NOT person re-identification) is also treated as
condition-1-eligible. This is a deliberate, disclosed, real behavior
change, not an oversight: real corroboration from an independent sensor is
real supporting evidence that a MEDIUM event reflects a genuine,
physically consistent movement worth cross-command attention, even though
neither camera alone reached HIGH on its own. Scoped narrowly on purpose:
- Only MEDIUM is boosted, never LOW — see CORROBORATION_BOOST_SEVERITY.
- The boost threshold (CORROBORATION_BOOST_MIN_TC) is deliberately higher
  than cross_camera.py's own MIN_TC_TO_RECORD (0.15, "is there anything
  worth displaying") — this threshold gates a real alerting-behavior
  change, not just a display annotation, so it requires much stronger
  real corroboration before it fires.
- The original event.severity field itself (part of the edge's signed,
  tamper-evident record) is NEVER mutated — the boost only affects this
  function's local escalation-eligibility check. Every alert created via
  the boost path is transparently marked escalated_via_corroboration=True
  on the Alert row, so this is always auditable, never silent.
- Condition 2 (crosses_boundary) is unaffected by corroboration — the
  boost only ever widens which events pass condition 1.
