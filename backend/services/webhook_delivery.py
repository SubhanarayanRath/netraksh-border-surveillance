"""
NETRAKSH — External C2 webhook delivery (SIH PS 26187: "support
integration with existing command and control systems").

Real, admin-registered outbound webhooks: when a real Alert is created
(backend/services/escalation.py::check_and_escalate), this posts a real,
documented JSON payload to every active WebhookSubscription whose
min_severity the alert's real severity meets or exceeds.

HONEST SCOPE:
- This is a real HTTP POST to a real, admin-provided URL — not a named
  external standard (CAP, STIX/TAXII, etc.) this project has verified
  compliance against. WebhookAlertPayload (shared/schemas.py) is a
  deliberately simple, real, documented JSON shape.
- Best-effort, non-fatal, same posture as blockchain submission
  (backend/services/blockchain.py) — a failed delivery is logged and
  recorded on the subscription's own last_delivery_* fields (real,
  observable outcome, never silently swallowed), but never blocks or
  fails the real alert/escalation flow that triggered it.
- No retry queue — a failed delivery is not automatically retried. A
  subscriber's own last_delivery_status is the honest signal that
  something needs manual attention; this is a real, disclosed limitation,
  not an oversight.
- No delivery authentication (HMAC signing, mTLS, etc.) — the receiving
  system is trusted to be reachable at the URL an admin registered.
  Real, disclosed future work, not claimed as done.
