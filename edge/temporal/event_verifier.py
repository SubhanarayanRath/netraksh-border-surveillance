NETRAKSH Edge — Event Verification State Machine (Layer 4.5 / Priority 3).
Implements the EXACT lifecycle specified in architecture v4 §9 (locked):

    OBSERVED -> CANDIDATE -> [held while UNCERTAIN] -> VERIFIED -> ALERTED
                                                       -> ACKNOWLEDGED -> CLOSED

Design intent (from the architecture doc, do not deviate silently):
  - CANDIDATE: a task module (fence/loitering/abandoned/ANPR/face) fires once.
    Evidence is NOT packaged and no alert is raised yet.
  - A candidate accumulates one "confirmation" on every subsequent frame where
    the SAME condition is observed again for the SAME key AND the accompanying
    Reliability decision (edge.reliability.decision) for that frame is DETECTED.
  - A frame where the condition still holds but Reliability says UNCERTAIN does
    NOT count as a confirmation, but it does NOT reset progress either — the
    candidate is held pending, exactly as architecture v4 §9 specifies
    ("the candidate is held, not discarded, and re-evaluated on subsequent
    frames"). This is what prevents fog/night/degraded-camera moments from
    either (a) silently vanishing a real event, or (b) forcing a low-confidence
    frame to count as if it were solid evidence.
  - Once confirm_count reaches the event type's required_confirmations, the
    candidate is promoted straight to VERIFIED -> ALERTED in the same call,
    and the caller (edge/main.py) packages evidence for exactly that frame.
  - A candidate not reconfirmed at all within max_gap_frames expires with NO
    evidence generated. This — combined with the confirmation requirement
    above — is the concrete mechanism behind the project's stated thesis:
    a single noisy frame cannot become a security alert.

Different event types need different confirmation depth:
  - Zone/fence crossing (and line crossing, once built) are edge-triggered on
    a single frame transition, so they are the type most exposed to one-frame
    tracking jitter -- default requires multiple consecutive confirmations.
  - Loitering and abandoned-object already require sustained dwell/stationary
    time *inside their own task module* before they ever fire a candidate in
    the first place (see edge/rules/modules.py), so their temporal persistence
    is already baked in -- default requires only 1 confirmation (auto-verify
    on first candidate), so we do not double-gate and delay a real alert for
    no reason. ANPR/face-detection results are single-shot reads, not a
    condition that persists across frames, so they default to 1 as well.

This module is a pure in-memory state tracker with no I/O and no side effects
beyond its own state, deliberately structured the same way as
edge/reliability/decision.py so it is unit-testable the same way.
