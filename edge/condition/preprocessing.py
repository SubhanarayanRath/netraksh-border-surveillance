"""
NETRAKSH Edge — CLAHE Preprocessing (architecture v4 §3).
Applies CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to the
luminance channel of a frame before detection, ONLY when the Scene Condition
Engine has already classified the scene as LOW_LIGHT_NIGHT or FOG_RAIN.

This produces a SEPARATE, enhanced copy used only as the detector's input —
camera health monitoring, scene condition classification, evidence
snapshots, and ANPR/face crops all continue to use the original,
unmodified frame. Enhancing before classification would make a genuinely
dark/foggy scene measure as better than it is, corrupting the very signal
(S in the Hybrid Reliability Engine, edge/reliability/decision.py) that
depends on being honest about scene quality.

Explicitly a MITIGATION, not a fix: the detector is still COCO-pretrained,
not night/fog-trained. CLAHE improves local contrast for the detector's
existing weights; it does not add information the sensor didn't capture,
and it does not close the underlying training-data gap. See
docs/LIMITATIONS.md.
