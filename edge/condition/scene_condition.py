"""
NETRAKSH Edge — Scene Condition Classifier (Gate 2).
Classifies the current visual scene into one of four buckets:
  CLEAR_DAY | LOW_LIGHT_NIGHT | FOG_RAIN | GLARE

Uses pure OpenCV heuristics — no model required for MVP.
Each bucket corresponds to a different calibrated confidence threshold in Gate 3.

A single global threshold is provably wrong across day/night/fog — this is why
condition classification exists as its own gate.

        a real fog+glare scene measured whole-frame contrast_std≈41 — ABOVE
        FOG_CONTRAST_THRESHOLD (30) — purely because a small, genuinely
        bright glare region pulled the aggregate up, even though the
        non-glare majority of the frame was genuinely hazy (low real
        contrast). Excluding the same near-white band glare_fraction already
        flags (>= _GLARE_PIXEL_VALUE) removes that region's disproportionate
        influence, so this reflects what a viewer looking at just the
        non-blown-out part of the frame would actually see.

        Falls back to the whole-frame std if every pixel is blown out (glare
        fills the entire frame) — there is no "non-glare region" left to
        measure separately in that case, and 0.0 would incorrectly read as
        "perfectly uniform," not "fully saturated."
